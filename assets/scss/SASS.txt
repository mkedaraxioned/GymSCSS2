Sass stands for Syntactically Awesome Stylesheet
Sass is an extension to CSS
Sass is a CSS pre-processor
Sass is completely compatible with all versions of CSS
Sass reduces repetition of CSS and therefore saves time



Preprocessing
CSS on its own can be fun, but stylesheets are getting larger, more complex, and harder to maintain.
This is where a preprocessor can help. Sass lets you use features that don't exist in CSS yet like
 variables, nesting, mixins, inheritance and other nifty goodies that make writing CSS fun again.

Sass has two syntaxes. The most commonly used syntax is known as “SCSS” (for “Sassy CSS”),
 and is a superset of CSS3’s syntax. This means that every valid CSS3
 stylesheet is valid SCSS as well. SCSS files use the extension .scss.

The second, older syntax is known as the indented syntax (or just “.sass”). Inspired by Haml’s terseness, it’s intended for people who prefer conciseness over similarity to CSS. Instead of brackets and semicolons, it uses the 
indentation of lines to specify blocks. Files in the indented syntax use the extension .sass.
